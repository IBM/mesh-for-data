# Release Process

The process of creating a release is described in this document. Replace `X.Y.Z` with the version to be released.

## 1. Optionally update the ArrowFlight releases file

The file `./site/arrowFlightReleases` contains a map between fybrik and the arrow-flight-module releases.
The quick start uses this file to map to a relevant arrow-flight release.
* If there is a perfect march for the fybrik release is defined, its value will be used.
* Otherwise, the major and minor fybrik release will be checked.
* If there is no matches, the `latest` arrow-flight release will be used.

For example, if the file content is:

```yaml
v0.5: v0.5.0
v0.5.3: v0.5.3
v0.6: v0.6.0
```
The v0.5.3 fybrik release will use the v0.5.3 release of arrow-flight.
The v0.6.1 fybrik release will be mapped to the v0.6.0 of arrow-flight.

## 2. Create a `releases/X.Y.Z` branch

The `releases/X.Y.Z` branch should be created from a base branch. 

For major and minor releases the base is `master` and for patch releases (fixes) the base is `releases/X.Y.(Z-1)`.
A new patch release should be created before merging pull-requests as described in the next section.

You can do that [directly from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch).

## 3. Optionally create Pull Requests to `releases/X.Y.Z`

For any change that is required on top of the base you should create a Pull Request targeting the **new** release branch. 

Pull requests to the release branch may contain bug fixes, security fixes and updated documentation.

Collaborators with `write` permissions can cherry-pick a Pull Request that is merged to `master` into the release branch by commenting on the Pull Request with:

```bash
/cherry-pick branch=releases/X.Y.Z
```

You should ensure that all Pull Requests that target the release branch are reviewed and merged before proceeding to the next step.

## 4. Create a [new release](https://github.com/fybrik/fybrik/releases/new)

Use `vX.Y.Z` tag and set `releases/X.Y.Z` as the target.

Ensure that the release notes explicitly mention upgrade instructions and any breaking change.

## 5. Update Helm charts

An automated Pull Request to update the Helm charts is created in [fybrik/charts](https://github.com/fybrik/charts/pulls). You must manually merge the Pull Request and ensure that a chart release is created after a couple of minutes.
