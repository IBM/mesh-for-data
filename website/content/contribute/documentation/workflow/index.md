The source of this website resides in the [`/website`](https://{{< github_base >}}/{{< github_repo >}}/tree/master/website)
folder of the project source. All the content, including all documentation, is managed in [`/website/content`](https://{{< github_base >}}/{{< github_repo >}}/tree/master/website/content) as markdown files.

Contributing to the documentation follows the same flow as [contributing code](../../code/flow/), with these additional requirements:
- **[Preview your changes locally](../build/)** to ensure that the content is displayed as intended.
- **[Contribute in the style of the project](../write/)** following our guidelines.

Thanks for your contribution!
